## Project Build Status: SUCCESS

The Agentium library has been successfully built and prepared for deployment with the following enhancements:

### Version 1.1.0 New Features:
- **Gemini AI Integration** - Full Google Gemini API support
- **Professional Documentation** - Removed all emojis for business-ready appearance
- **Beginner-Friendly Setup** - Comprehensive API key setup instructions
- **Enhanced Sample Projects** - All 5 projects updated with clear documentation
- **CrewAI Removal** - Cleaned up and removed deprecated CrewAI integration

## Build Output:
âœ… **Successfully Created:**
- `dist/agentium-1.1.0-py3-none-any.whl` (105 KB)
- `dist/agentium-1.1.0.tar.gz` (76.7 KB)

## API Token Issue:
The current PyPI API token appears to be invalid or expired. To complete deployment:

### Option 1: Generate New API Token
1. Visit https://pypi.org/manage/account/token/
2. Create a new API token for the "agentium" project
3. Update the token and run deployment

### Option 2: Manual PyPI Upload
1. Visit https://pypi.org/project/agentium/
2. Use the web interface to upload the built files from `dist/` folder

### Option 3: Command Line with New Token
```bash
# Set new token
export TWINE_USERNAME=__token__
export TWINE_PASSWORD=your_new_pypi_token_here

# Upload
python -m twine upload dist/*
```

## Deployment Command (Once Token is Updated):
```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
$env:TWINE_USERNAME="__token__"
$env:TWINE_PASSWORD="your_new_pypi_token_here"
D:/RNS/Agentium-Python-Library-/.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m twine upload dist/*
```

## Post-Deployment Verification:
Once deployed, users can install the enhanced version with:
```bash
# Install latest version
pip install agentium==1.1.0

# With AI features
pip install agentium[ai]==1.1.0
```

## Key Improvements in v1.1.0:
- Professional documentation without emojis
- Clear API key setup instructions for beginners
- Enhanced error handling and fallbacks
- Gemini AI integration with model selection
- Updated sample projects with comprehensive guides
- Removed deprecated CrewAI integration

The project is ready for deployment once the API token is refreshed!
